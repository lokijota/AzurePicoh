# Azure Picoh

Samples using the Picoh device from Ohbot and Azure.

All the samples were built on Windows and use Azure capabilities like the IoT Hub.

[Picoh responding to IoT Hub events](/IoTHub/Demoscript.md)

In this sample IoT Hub's cloud-to-device messages capabilties are ilustrated. Python code running on the PC to where the Picoh is connected subscribes to messages pushed to a device, and then reacts to those messages - by using speech capabilities to read the content of the message.

Sample uses Python, the Picoh Python SDK and IoTHub's Python SDKs.
